This was created during the Hack(H)er 413 2023 hackathon and won "Best Use of Data" for its application of thousands of data points.

## tools used
I used [this](https://ling.meluhha.com/ipaify/) tool to convert the input text into its IPA symbols, then analyzed that IPA input to get the result.

You can see all the data and sources I used [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cEY6MT7JBya7lUA-BSsu1jBg7dlKuyASVjXhNJgXd6M/edit?usp=sharing), as well as what information I got from each of those sources.
